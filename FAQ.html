		<h3> A note from the Founder and CEO </h3>
		<p> My name is Clint Knox and I’m a 9th grade English teacher at a traditional public high school in Colorado Springs, CO.
		I’ve taught History and English from 6th to 11th grade and am starting my 9th year of teaching.
		I’ve been wanting to blend my classroom for some time but never found any tool that actually held
		my students accountable for online lessons. Tired of non-educators selling products that didn’t actually work in a real
		classroom setting, I decided to create my own solution. We are just getting started on a long and exciting journey!
		Please contact me anytime for questions or feedback at <b><u>welcome@brainitz.com</u></b></p>
		<h3>What is Brainitz?</h3>
		<p>Brainitz is a tool to allow teachers to embed questions into video lessons.</p>
		<h3>What makes Brainitz different?</h3>
		<p>Students MUST answer the questions correctly in order to progress through the video. If a student answers
		a question incorrectly, they are taken back in the video to the point where the “missed” information
		was presented. The student must rewatch that section of the video and answer the question again before proceeding.</p>
		<h3>As a teacher will this save me time?</h3>
		<p>Yes! Yes! Yes! By using Brainitz to blend your classroom, your students will have access to your
		instruction any time, any where. This means you don’t have to reinstruct lessons for students who missed class
		and come in during your lunch and ask “Did I miss anything today?”</p>
		<h3>Is this good for kids?</h3>
		<p>Absolutely Yes! With Brainitz, students have access to your lessons any time, any where. In addition, students are automatically
		reinstructed on information they didn’t understand the first time. Beyond being a good instructional technique, we will be collecting
		data this year to show how much Brainitz improves student achievement.</p>
